  title: Aggregate QoS Booking and Device Assignment
  description: |
    This API enables API consumers to request, in advance, certain network performance to be provided by Telco networks, without having in-depth knowledge of the underlying network complexities (e.g. the 4G/5G system in case of a mobile network) for a number of devices, at a given location, for a period of time.

    The API enables API consumers to book a specific QoS profile for one or more devices with conditions such as the start time, duration and location. Once the booking is confirmed the enduser can assign devices to the booking.
    The network operator will provision and activate those devices with the required and agreed network quality at the given time and conditions

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **QoS profiles**:
    Latency, throughput or priority requirements of the application mapped to relevant QoS profile values. The set of QoS Profiles that a network operator is offering may be retrieved via the `qos-profiles` API (cf. https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/) or will be agreed during the onboarding with the API service provider.

    * **Identifier for the device**:
    At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the network operator for the device, at the request time. After the booking request is accepted, the device may get different IP addresses, but the booking will still apply to the device that was identified during the request process. Note: Network Access Identifier is defined for future use and will not be supported with v0.1 of the API.

    * **Notification URL and token**:
    API consumers may provide a callback URL (`sink`) on which notifications about all status change events (e.g. duration expiration) can be received from the API provider. This is an optional parameter. The notification will be sent as a CloudEvent compliant message. If `sink` is included, it is RECOMMENDED for the client to provide as well the `sinkCredential` property to protect the notification endpoint. In the current version,`sinkCredential.credentialType` MUST be set to `ACCESSTOKEN` if provided.

    # Resources and Operations overview
    The API defines six major operations in two groups:
    
    Booking:

    - An operation to setup a new QoS Booking for one or more devices.
    - An operation to get the information about an existing QoS Booking, identified by its `BookingId`.
    - An operation to terminate an existing QoS Booking, identified by its `BookingId`.

    Device Assignment:

     - An operation to assign one or more devices to the existing booking identified by its 'BookingId'
     - An operation to release one or more devices from the booking identified by its 'BookingId'
     - An operation to get all the associated QoS Booking for a given device.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios where more than one mobile device is associated with a phone number (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify the device to which the enhanced QoS profile should apply from that phone number. If the phone number is used as the device identifier when creating a QoS booking in a multi-SIM scenario, the API may respond with an error, apply the enhanced QoS profile to all devices in the multi-SIM group, or apply the enhanced QoS profile to a single device in the multi-SIM group which may not be the intended device.

    Possible solutions in such a scenario include:
    - Using the authorisation code flow to obtain an access token, which will automatically identify the intended device
    - Identifying the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port
    - Check with the SIM provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device, and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available

        - If the booking is completed synchronously, the response will be 201 with `status` = `SCHEDULED`.
        - If the booking request is accepted but not yet completed, the response will be 201 with `status` = `REQUESTED`. 
        - If the operator determines synchronously that the booking request cannot be fulfilled, the response will be 201 with `status` = `UNAVAILABLE`.
        - If the request includes a notification callback, the client will receive a `status-changed` event with the outcome of the process. The event will be sent also for synchronous operations.
        - The devices can be assigned anytime from the time booking is SCHEDULED and before the scheduled duration ends.
        - StatusInfo contains additional information under certain conditions.

        - The access token may be either 2-legged or 3-legged.
          - If a 3-legged access token is used, the subject associated with the QoS Booking must also be associated with the access token.  In this case the optional `device` parameter MUST NOT be provided in the request.
          - If a 2-legged access token is used, the device parameter must be provided and identify a device.
        - The QoS Booking must have been created by the same API client given in the access token.
        - If no QoS booking is found for the requested device, an empty array is returned.
        - This call uses the POST method instead of GET to comply with the CAMARA Commonalities guidelines for sending sensitive or complex data in API calls. Since the device field may contain personally identifiable information, it should not be sent via GET.

        NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
        NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
